# Rust Todo List

This repository is made to be a simple project for me to learn more about Rust and how it can be applied on the web.

### Server

The server folder contains a backend that provides the basic CRUD for a todo app. The current technologies I'm using are:

-   [Actix](https://actix.rs/docs/http2)
-   [Serde](https://serde.rs/)
-   [Chrono](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/)

### Client

The client folder contains a basic frontend that uses create_signal, create_effect, and create_memo to create a form and a list of todos.
