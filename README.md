# Rust Todo List

This repository is made to be a simple project for me to learn more about Rust and how it can be applied on the web.

### Server

The server is a backend that provides the basic CRUD for a todo app. The current technologies I'm using are:

- [Actix](https://actix.rs/docs/http2)
- [Serde](https://serde.rs/)
- [Chrono](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/)

### Client

In development...
